# Mapplic Plugin Customization

## Notes

```js
var Mapplic = function(element){}
self.el = element;
```

Here Mapplic var has one parameter which is element and we have the option of passing element to it. Inside it is init to this.el .
el means mapplic 'element' the thing that we want to change is tooltip, there is one called tooltip-hover as well which we don't really want to edit at the moment.
